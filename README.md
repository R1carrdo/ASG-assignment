# Take-Home Test: Vehicle Inspection System

A full-stack vehicle inspection management system using React + TypeScript (frontend) and Express + TypeScript (backend).

**Recommended Time: around 2 hours** — You may take as long as you need, but please don't overthink it.

***

## Backend Tasks (`/backend`)

### Task 1: Implement `createCheck` controller

The `POST /checks` endpoint controller is not implemented. You need to:

1. Validate request body using `validateCheckRequest(req.body)`
2. Return 400 with `ErrorResponse` format if validation fails
3. Call `checkService.createCheck()` if validation passes
4. Return 201 with the created check

**Verify:** Remove `.skip` from the test `"should create check and return 201"` in `api.test.ts`

### Task 2: Fix the bug in service function `createCheck`

The `hasIssue` flag is not correctly identifying if an inspection record has an issue. Find and fix the bug.

**Verify:** Remove `.skip` from the test `"should set hasIssue to true when any item fails"` in `api.test.ts`

Run `npm test` — all tests should pass.

### Task 3: Complete `deleteCheck` controller

The `DELETE /checks/:id` endpoint is not completed. It will not process the deletion and will return `501` regardless of the success or failure of the deletion. Complete this controller and related service function if applicable.

## Frontend Tasks (`/frontend`)

### Task 1: Fix Form Input

Check the form (of Submit Vehicle Inspection Result) to make sure the fields are accepting valid input and address any other bugs.

### Task 2: Change dropdown selection for checklist items

In the form, instead of a dropdown to select the result for checklist items, change them to checkboxes, radio buttons, or any other input type that you think is suitable.

### Task 3: Add Notes Field

In the form, add a textarea for optional notes:

- Maximum 300 characters
- (Optional) Display character counter (e.g., "45/300")
- Include in API request and reset after submission

### Task 4: Implement Toast Notifications

**File:** `src/CheckForm.tsx`

Show visual feedback using the provided `Toast.tsx` and `useToast.ts`:

- Success toast on successful submission
- Error toast on failure
- (Optional) Show a good error message in toast on failure

### Task 5: (Optional) Implement a way to delete an inspection record

Note that this task is **completely optional** and we do not expect you to finish this. However, if you wish, you can implement a way to delete an inspection record, provided that you have completed the `deleteCheck` controller. We will provide feedback if you choose to complete this task.

## Questions

Please answer these briefly:

1. **Authentication:** If we need to add authentication to this system, how would you approach it?

   I would implement JWT based authentication.

   &#x20;
   - Backend: Add a user model with password hashing, a login endpoint to issue short-lived JWT tokens, and middleware to verify tokens for protected routes. Implement role-based access control to restrict actions.
   - Frontend: Add login and logout UI, store JWT in secure HTTP-only cookies or localStorage, attach the token to API requests via the Authorization header, and protect routes with React Router guards to restrict unauthenticated access.
2. **Improvements:** What other improvements would you implement if this were going to production or if you have more time?

   Backend: Replace in-memory storage with a persistent database, add pagination and filtering for the /checks endpoint, implement rate limiting, structured logging, and error monitoring. Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

   Frontend: Add comprehensive form validation, implement responsive design for mobile devices, add loading states and error boundaries, write unit and E2E tests, and optimize bundle size with code splitting.

   General: Enforce HTTPS for all communications, implement data backup strategies, add audit logging for all user actions, and create API documentation.
3. **Tech Stack Experience:** Do you have experience with PHP, Vue.js, or mobile app development (React Native/Flutter)?

   With a solid CS and AI background, I combine backend/AI/full-stack skills with Agile project management to deliver projects efficiently. I have intermediate experience with PHP and Laravel for REST API development, basic experience with Vue.js and the Composition API, and intermediate experience with React Native for mobile app development, alongside basic Flutter experience for personal projects.
4. **AI / Tools:** What tools/assistants did you use while working on this assignment (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)? We appreciate AI usage, we're interested in _how_ you use these tools.

   GitHub Copilot: Used for code autocompletion, boilerplate generation, and quick syntax suggestions.

   ChatGPT: Used to validate best practices, debug specific logic issues, and generate clear explanations for complex problems.

   VS Code + ESLint/Prettier: Used for code editing, formatting, and linting to maintain consistent code quality.
5. **Visa Status:** What visa are you currently on?

   Currently on a **Student Visa (subclass 500)** valid
6. **Languages:** What language(s) do you speak and what's your proficiency level?

   **English**: Fluent (professional working proficiency, C1 level).

   **Mandarin (Chinese)**: Native proficiency.

> **Tip:** You can write your answers directly in this README.md file below each question.

## Submission (How to Submit)

1. Create a **public GitHub repository** for this assignment.
2. Push your code with all changes.
3. **Create at least two pull requests (PRs):** one for backend and one for frontend. You may create more (e.g., each task can be an independent PR). You may merge them into the main branch. We can review and may leave comments on your PRs for feedback.
4. Answer questions above.
5. **Please complete and submit within 3 days** unless otherwise discussed.
6. Send the repository link to **<admin@enroute-tech.com>**.
